## Project Overview

The **Conference Room Booking System** allows employees within an organisation to view available meeting rooms, make bookings, and manage reservations — all without needing to contact an administrator. It removes the friction of manually coordinating room availability and eliminates double-bookings.

**Who it is for:**
- **End users** – Employees who need to reserve a room for a meeting
- **Administrators** – Staff responsible for managing room availability and resolving conflicts
- **Developers** – Engineers onboarding to extend or maintain the system

This repository contains the source code, sprint documentation, and project artefacts produced during the development simulation.

## System Context

The system is structured around three major areas of responsibility:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Booking Engine** | Core logic for creating, updating, and cancelling reservations. Enforces availability rules and conflict detection. |
| **Room Management** | Handles the catalogue of rooms: capacity, location, equipment, and availability windows. |
| **User Interface** | The front-facing layer through which users interact with the system — browsing rooms, submitting bookings, and viewing their reservation history. |

These components communicate with a shared data layer. The system does not currently integrate with external calendar tools, though this is noted as a future enhancement.

## Sprint Artefacts

The `docs/` directory contains markdown artefacts produced during the sprint simulation. These are living documents and should be consulted when onboarding or reviewing the project's development history.

| Artefact | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Sprint Planning | `docs/sprint-planning/` | Goals, user stories, and task breakdown for each sprint |
| Retrospectives | `docs/retrospectives/` | Team reflections on process and delivery |
| System Diagrams | `docs/diagrams/` | High-level architecture and data flow visuals |
| Definition of Done | `docs/definition-of-done.md` | Acceptance criteria used during the sprint |

> New developers should read the most recent retrospective and sprint planning document before picking up any tasks.

## Contribution Workflow

This project uses **Pull Requests (PRs)** as the primary mechanism for contributing changes. Direct commits to `main` are not permitted.

### Branch Naming Convention

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/short-description` | `feature/room-filter-ui` |
| Bug fix | `fix/short-description` | `fix/double-booking-error` |
| Documentation | `docs/short-description` | `docs/update-readme` |

### Pull Request Expectations

A well-formed PR should:
- Explain **why** the change is being made (not just what)
- Describe what reviewers should focus on
- Reference relevant sprint documentation or issues where applicable
- Be small enough to review in a single sitting
